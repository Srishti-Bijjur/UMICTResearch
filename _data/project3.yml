  abstract: "My latest research explores ways in which Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can improve economic mobility among economically distressed communities. I take two separate approaches in this research. First, I leverage contextual inquiry and interviews consisting of design probes and user scenarios. The goal is to understand the unique barriers and opportunities for ICTs to help communities build, maintain, and use social capital to improve their economic mobility through job location."

  abstract: "In this project, we explore existing data from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) at the University of Michigan to understand how individuals unable to afford a formal education perform in these courses as compared to those able to afford formal education. I plan to extend the results of the quantitative data and conduct semi-structured interviews to understand if and how MOOCs are being used to increase employment opportunities."
