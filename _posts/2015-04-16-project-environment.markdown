subtitle: "Socioeconomic factors play an important but largely hidden role in home-energy consumption. Most studies have targeted single-family, affluent households, and as a result, energy monitoring systems do not address the needs of renters and low-income individuals. These projects aim to fill this open area of research."

description: "Socioeconomic factors play an important but largely hidden role in home-energy consumption. Most studies have targeted single-family, affluent households, and as a result, energy monitoring systems do not address the needs of renters and low-income individuals. Thirty-five percent of the U.S. population rent their homes (NMHC, 2012), and 32% of households earn less than $30k per year (U.S. Census, 2012). Though median energy use for home heating and cooling is the same as that in more affluent households, low-income households must spend a greater percentage of their incomeon energy (Bin, 2002). Renters lack full autonomy over their homes due to tenancy issues, and class and poverty issues affect the autonomy of individuals with respect to energy use. Exactly how autonomy and tenantsâ€™ relationships with other stakeholders affect their use of energy was not well understood, and details about energy use in low-income households were relatively unknown in HCI. Our projects help to fill this open area of research."
