subtitle: "Understanding the prospects for adapting technologies, such as online labor markets, to build and exploit both personal and impersonal SocioTechnical Capital (e.g., particularly among those with limited social and human capital) requires an understanding of barriers that will need to be overcome to make such tools useful. This project aims to investigate and overcome these barriers and to design and implement tools that are more useful to these communities."
